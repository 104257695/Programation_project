The position of a moving object is x(t) = (5+2*t)^3+5*t Determine the instantaneous velocity.;5+6*(5+2*t)^2
Use the previously obtained velocity to calculate the instantaneous acceleration.;12*t
Calculate the displacement if it starts from rest until t  = 2 s using the velocity function v(t) = 10*t^2+6 ;22
If an object has constant acceleration, its velocity changes linearly with time.;T
The derivative of position with respect to time is force.;f
