Given a force F(t) = 6*t^2 acting on a mass m  = 4 find the final velocity starting from rest at t  = 5 s;187.50
The position of a moving object is x(t) = sqrt(t)+4*t^2 Determine the instantaneous velocity.;1/(2*sqrt(t))+8*t
Use the previously obtained velocity to calculate the instantaneous acceleration.;12*t
Calculate the displacement if it starts from rest until t  = 2 s using the velocity function v(t) = 8*t^2+4 ;14
If an object has constant acceleration, its velocity changes linearly with time.;true
What is the work done by a normal force? A-always positive B-always negative C-depends on angle D-usually zero;D
Newton's first law defines inertia.;t
If a force of F = 10 N is applied to an object of P = 4 N, what is its acceleration?;24.5
A particle has acceleration a(t) = 4*t Calculate the velocity starting from rest at t  = 3 s ;18
The kinetic energy is E(t) = (0.5)*m*(2*t)^2 with P = 3 Calculate the rate of change of kinetic energy at time t  = 4 s ;24.00
