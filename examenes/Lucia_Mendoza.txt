The position of a moving object is x(t) = (6+2*t)^3+5*t Determine the instantaneous velocity.;5+6*(6+2*t)^2
Use the previously obtained velocity to calculate the instantaneous acceleration.;12*t
Calculate the displacement if it starts from rest until t  = 2 s using the velocity function v(t) = 11*t^2+7 ;26
If an object has constant acceleration, its velocity changes linearly with time.;T
Which type of energy depends on an object's position? A-kinetic B-potential C-thermal D-radiant;B
The direction of acceleration is always the same as the direction of velocity.;False
If a force of F = 13 N is applied to an object of P = 7 N, what is its acceleration?;18.2
A particle has acceleration a(t) = 4*t Calculate the velocity starting from rest at t  = 3 s ;18
The kinetic energy is E(t) = (0.5)*m*(2*t)^2 with P = 6 Calculate the rate of change of kinetic energy at time t  = 7 s ;84.00
Given a force F(t) = 6*t^2 acting on a mass m  = 7 find the final velocity starting from rest at t  = 5 s;107.14
