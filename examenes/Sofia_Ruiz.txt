The position of a moving object is x(t) = (5+t)^2+3*e^(2*t) Determine the instantaneous velocity.;2*(5+t)+6*e^(2*t)
Use the previously obtained velocity to calculate the instantaneous acceleration.;2+12*exp(2*t)
Calculate the displacement if it starts from rest until t  = 2 s using the velocity function v(t) = 16*t^2+12 ;46
If an object has constant acceleration, its velocity changes linearly with time.;t
What is the SI unit of force? A-meter B-newton C-kilogram D-pascal;B
The derivative of position with respect to time is force.;false
If a force of F = 18 N is applied to an object of P = 12 N, what is its acceleration?;14.6
A particle has acceleration a(t) = 4*t Calculate the velocity starting from rest at t  = 3 s ;18
The kinetic energy is E(t) = (0.5)*m*(2*t)^2 with P = 11 Calculate the rate of change of kinetic energy at time t  = 12 s ;264
